## Preface
In bigdata domain, there are a lot excellent open source and commercial softwares, which provide various field solutions such as cost-friendly storage, compute engine, OLAP.

However, overmuch technology components also leads to complexity, which effect negative impact on cost and efficiency, enterprise has to employ developer with specific skill or knowledge to achieve digital decision.

Scaleph trys to provide an admin data platform helping developer or enterprise build data application quickly. Through providing out of the box admin data platform, developers will not need to waste time on choosing and composing multiple components to determine enterprise data platform,  scaleph pre-made decisions are responsible for these common challenges such as data integration, data develop or schedule.

Flink is the most popular stateful computation engine and so many enterprise examples have proven its low latency and high throughput feature, scaleph chooses Flink as the data process engine.

Samely, SeaTunnel(incubating) is an easy to use and rich components data integration framework, support Flink or Spark engine, and has an active community, scaleph has developed an web click-and-drag ui for SeaTunnel.
